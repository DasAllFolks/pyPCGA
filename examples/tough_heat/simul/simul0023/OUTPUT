                    TOUGH2 IS A PROGRAM FOR MULTIPHASE MULTICOMPONENT FLOW IN PERMEABLE MEDIA, INCLUDING HEAT FLOW.
              IT IS A MEMBER OF THE MULKOM FAMILY OF CODES, DEVELOPED  AT LAWRENCE BERKELEY LABORATORY BY KARSTEN PRUESS ET AL.
                                    PARALLELIZATION OF THE TOUGH FAMILY CODES WAS DONE BY KENI ZHANG ET AL.

 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

 Modification of absolute permeability on a grid block-by-grid block basis will be made when a domain "SEED " is present in data
 block "ROCKS", as follows.
                                    k    --->    k' = k*m

 Here, k is the absolute permeability specified for the reservoir domain to which the grid block belongs. Parameter m is a
 "permeability modifier" which can be internally generated or externally prescribed by the user on a block-by-block basis.

 When permeability modification is in effect, the strength of capillary pressure will, following Leverett (1941), automatically be
 scaled as   Pcap ---> Pcap' = Pcap/SQRT(m).

 User-supplied permeability modifiers have to be entered as parameter "PMX" in columns 41-50 of an ELEMEnt record.
 Permeability modification options are selected through parameters in data block "ROCKS".
